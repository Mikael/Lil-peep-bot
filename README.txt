Installing the bot:
When hosting the bot on your own device:
- Place the files in a new directory.
- Then go into CMD and write: "npm i"
- Note, you need node.js and npm to run the above command. (If you host the bot with a hosting, you can ask them for further support with this.)
- If you run the bot on your own device I can help you install it as much as possible.
- Start the Start.bat file to run your bot. You can find this file in the main folder.
- Run the !setup command.
- Have fun!

When hosting the bot at a hosting company:
- Place the files in the allocated directory of the host.
- Run the "npm i" command to install the dependencies.
- Start the bot (ensure that the hosting will target the index.js file)
- Run the !setup command.
- Have fun!
